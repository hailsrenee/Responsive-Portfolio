            <p>I am a full stack web developer living in Tucson, AZ with my cat and two dogs. I grew up in rural Indiana and 
            earned my Bachelor of Sciences from Indiana University. I graduated early in the fall of 2014 with a major 
            in Speech and Hearing Sciences and minors in Psychology and Spanish.</p><p> After graduating from IU, I moved to Tucson 
            to escape both the snow and the small town mentality and I haven't looked back. 
            I worked for several years as a server at The Arizona Inn and got my Real Estate license before deciding 
            to return to school at The University of Arizona in the fall of 2018. I wasn't originally sure which 
            career path I wanted to follow so I simulatneously pursued my Doctorate in Audiology as well as a 
            certificate in full stack web development.
